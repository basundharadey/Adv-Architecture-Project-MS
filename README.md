We are going to investigate on improving Cache efficiency by predicting and eliminating dead blocks after a Cache Burst. A Cache burst begins when a block in cache become most recently used (MRU) and ends up when the same becomes non-MRU. As a formal definition-“A cache burst is the contiguous group of cache accesses a block receives while it is in the MRU position of its cache set with no intervening references to any other block in the same set.” Due to the presence of dead blocks in the cache for a long period of time with no use, before the eviction, the cache efficiency decreases. So, other than increasing the capacity of cache, we can increase the number of live blocks instead of dead ones for better performance. So in this project, we will work on dead block predictors (DBP). The earlier we identify a dead block, there will be more opportunity to improve the cache efficiency.  With addition to that, we will also keep an eye on best tradeoff between timeliness and prediction accuracy/coverage, by making dead block predictions at different points during the dead time of a block.  Moreover, Cache bursts only work well at the L1 cache. For the L2 cache, counting-based predictors work best. We also consider RefCount+ (helps in handling confidence bit and current history store) predictor.
